# With feedback - from Stuart at Navis
Hi Antonella - thanks for submitting your app!
Nice work. You've proven a good working knowledge of the concepts required to build a basic API-driven application with React. Some of the highlights for me:
* Your project is very well organized
* You've included everything expected of modern app (babel, webpack, package.json scripts)
* The app works... and looks good! :)
* The code is well structured and your components are broken up logically
* Nice use of the components / containers / services separation patterns
* Testing! Seriously, excellent use of tests. We use snapshot testing across our UI framework. I appreciate your taking time to showcase your knowledge here.
I left a few comments across the files to give examples of what you might receive from a typical code review at Navis. All in all, this is very good work and I think you should be proud of your submission. I look forward to discussing the exercise and any questions you might have about my feedback.
